1.design decisions

    BufferPool: change linkedlist to hashmap, in order to easily maintain a LRU map. Add a LRUmap to
                realize evict policy.

2.API

    no changes

3.Incomplete elements

    in B+tree implementation, we should delete tuple/entry first before add to another page. At first, I don't
    use any evict policy and the systemtest cost much time, so I add LRU evit policy to speed up the bufferpool.

4.Others

    spent 10 hours to do this course work.
