1.design decisions

    In order to deal with lock acquire or release, I create a class named PageLock to store all the information about lock of a page. For deadlock detection, I created a dependency graph and use DFS to detect the deadlocks. For transaction complete, I just follow the document.

2.API

    no changes

3.Incomplete elements

    nothing.

4.Others

    spent 10 hours to do this course work. However, something strange happened in my computer. When I use the Idea IntelliJ to test the system test transactiontest, I can pass it with around 2-4 minutes, but the program won't stop when I use ant system test.
