# Writeup for lab1

###Describe any design decisions you made. 

I don't think there's any newly designed part of this lab, everything is written naturally. This lab leave no space for design decisions indeed.

### Discuss and justify any changes you made to the API.

No change is made to the API.

###Describe any missing or incomplete elements of your code.

Those code to be finished in the future lab.

###Describe how long you spent on the lab, and whether there was anything you found particularly difficult or confusing

About half a day? The most difficult thing was that I forgot how to code in Java, and it take me long time to find stupid mistakes.
